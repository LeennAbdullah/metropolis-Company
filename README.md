Metropolis Transit is a new corporation managing regional transit for a large metropolitan 
area and has been formed from a number of smaller, local mass transit providers. Metropolis 
transit has hired multiple consulting firms to assist them in building new infrastructure and in 
integrating the systems of the smaller, local providers into one infrastructure. Your firm has been contracted to help Metropolis 
Transit to develop a threat model analyzing potential risk to their proposed infrastructure. 

The proposed Metropolis Transit network implements of a classic DMZ that houses a 
number of classic services that are often externally accessible, although not all hosts placed in 
the DMZ will be externally accessible. Metropolis Transit plans to closely monitor all traffic into 
and out of the DMZ. Additionally, Metropolis Transit intends to operate a number of Internet of 
Things devices for passenger management. These will range from point-of-sale systems that 
passengers can use to purchase tickets to ticket readers placed in busses. 

Metropolis Transit will operate the corporate environment behind this DMZ. An interior 
router will direct traffic to one of four networks. The TIS subnet will host systems and services 
needed by Metropolis Transitâ€™s Technology Information Systems department to support 
corporate operations. The enterprise subnet will largely host workstations used by Metropolis 
Transit corporate employees. The garage subnet will host older work stations that have been 
issued to Metropolis Transit maintenance locations and will largely be used for tracking inventory 
and for fleet management. Finally, Metropolis Transit will operate a subnet used by developers 
to systems and code not yet ready for production.
